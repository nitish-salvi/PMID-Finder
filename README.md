This will explain the code and how to use the script to parse through the PubMed database

## Installing pips
Before running the scripts make sure to have the latest version of python installed and follow the instructions given by the official python website.

After installing python, in command prompt type: **pip install biopython**

## Other Prerequisites
Download this script (PubMedApiv3) to your local machine. Upon completion move it to a known location on your drive. I recommend creating a new folder on your desktop for easy access. 

### Running the script
Locate the local file, double click it. The script will open in command prompt where you can follow the given instructions.

#### Walkthrough
Running this script may be confusing so here is an in-depth exploration. 

Upon running, the script will prompt you for a primary topic. Type in any topic. 

You will then be prompted for sub-topics, you can type one then press enter and you will be prompted again. Once you are finished entering subtopics individually, type this phrase *done*.

The script will begin to process articles from PubMed's database by subtopic.

In the location that you store the script, there will be folders created with a topic. Inside that main topic folder, there will be all the subtopic folders.
